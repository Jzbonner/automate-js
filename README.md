### Tools 
* [üåä - current] **Web Scraping with Puppeteer.js** - a sandbox environment for webscraping data off a variety of internet resources 
* [] **Medical Prescription** - (scraped data) 
* [] **Music Release Dates** - (scraped data)
* [] **Mergers and Acquisitions** - (scraped data)

## Web Scraping with Python üåè
Using a combination of node and puppeteer.js developers can automate scraping web data for a varierty of purposes. I intend to create simple examples for pulling in data and scale out these examples into multi-use componets for larger projects. Will look to package the "automation" aspects of this micro project into a microservice that can be connected a relational/non-relational database depending on the data type.
